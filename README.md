## General Information
There are many students around me who don't like to read and many libraries are deserted and neglected. This project is made so that everyone can easily access the library with easy maintenance.


## Requirements
You will need a server with:
- PHP 7.4 or newer
- Laravel 8.X or newer
- Composer
- Git
- MySQL


## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using:

$ cd ../pro_perpus
$ composer install
$ npm install
$ cp .env.example .env
$ php artisan key:generate

- After you create a database and inform .env file, run this:

$ php artisan migrate --seed
$ php artisan serve
